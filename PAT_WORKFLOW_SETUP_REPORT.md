# PAT Method Development Workflow Setup Report

## Overview
This setup creates a comprehensive Process Analytical Technology (PAT) workflow system with the following components:

## Tasks (8 total)
- **Sample Measurement** (Preparation): Measure sample weight and properties
- **Mixing** (Operation): Mix materials using automated mixer
- **Monitor** (Data Collection): Monitor process parameters using NIR spectroscopy
- **Calibration** (Data Analysis): Calibrate analytical models with reference data
- **Code** (Calculation): Execute custom calculation and analysis code
- **Blending** (Operation): Blend materials using high-shear blender
- **Dashboard** (Visualization): Display real-time process dashboard
- **Control** (Control): Automated process control and optimization

## Instruments (5 total)
- **Weight Balance** (Equipment): Mettler Toledo XPE205 - High-precision analytical balance for sample measurement
- **Mixer** (Equipment): IKA RW20 - Overhead stirrer for sample mixing and homogenization
- **NIR** (Sensor): Bruker MPA II - Near-infrared spectrometer for real-time process monitoring
- **Blender** (Equipment): Silverson L5M-A - High-shear mixer for blending and particle size reduction
- **Database** (Software): PostgreSQL v14 - Database system for data storage and retrieval

## Services (8 total)
- **Run Weight Balance** (Sample Measurement): Execute weight measurement using analytical balance
- **Run Mixer** (Operation): Execute mixing operation with precise control
- **Run Blender** (Operation): Execute blending operation for material homogenization
- **Run NIR** (Spectroscopy): Execute NIR spectroscopic analysis with data processing
- **Develop Model** (Code): Develop predictive models using multivariate analysis
- **Apply Model** (Code): Apply trained models for real-time prediction
- **Visualize** (Visualization): Generate real-time visualizations and dashboards
- **Data Extraction** (Database): Extract and process data from multiple sources

## Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture where:

1. **Tasks** define the workflow steps and requirements
2. **Instruments** represent physical/software components with status endpoints
3. **Services** provide executable operations that connect to instruments
4. **Workflows** combine tasks, instruments, and services into executable processes

## Endpoints
- Instrument status endpoints: 5001-5005
- Service execution endpoints: 6001-6008
- All endpoints use HTTP REST API for communication

## Next Steps
1. Implement instrument simulators
2. Create service execution scripts
3. Set up database schemas
4. Update frontend components
5. Test end-to-end workflow execution
